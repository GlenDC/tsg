# L18n Examples

Within this directory you find L18n examples demonstrating how you can localize
your website. When we think about localization we often think about translation,
but know that all layouts, pages and includes can be localized simply by providing
multiple versions of the same file name. This can be used for different language locales,
but also for any other similar concept you can think of.
